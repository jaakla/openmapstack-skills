"""SKILL.md is a router, so its pointers must resolve (issue #26).

`SKILL.md` is the always-loaded entry point: consuming agents read it and then
open whichever `references/*.md` it names. A pointer to a file that does not
exist sends an agent looking for guidance that is not there, and a reference
nothing points at is guidance no agent will ever load. Neither shows up in the
fixture evals, which grade produced projects rather than the routing table.
