"""Shipped corrections that a live acceptance run caught must not silently revert.

The 0.4.0 acceptance run (see `docs/release-0.4.0.md`) found two task-outcome
failures that traced to shipped guidance rather than to the adapter or model:
an agent claimed a plain `geom` GiST index serves a `::geography` predicate, and
another treated a WFS `resultType=hits` total as proof of completeness. Both
sentences were corrected, and both reruns then passed.

Nothing else in the repository can notice if that wording goes away. The routing
eval grades *selection* only -- `evals/routing.py` reports `task_success` as
`not_testable` by construction -- and the fixture evals grade produced projects,
not the reference text an agent reads before producing one. So a later edit
could reintroduce either error and every automated check would stay green.

These are content assertions, and that is their whole claim: they prove the
corrective guidance is still shipped in every payload that carries the file, and
that the retracted advice has not come back. They do **not** prove an agent
reads it or acts on it. That remains the job of the live cases
`chosen-engine-sql` and `bounded-discovery` in `evals/routing-cases.yaml`, graded
against the rubric in `evals/final-state-acceptance.md`.

Rewording a requirement intentionally means updating the assertion *and*
re-running the owning live case, not just relaxing the string.
