-- Northstar Mobility MotherDuck fixture: schema (examples/nyc-private-mobility)
-- Issue: https://github.com/jaakla/openmapstack-skills/issues/43
--
-- The private market-intelligence overlay: a shared POI-style source narrowed
-- to a fixed NYC subset, plus enrichment that only Northstar holds. That
-- combination -- public geometry, private scores -- is what makes the whole
-- database private, and it is why the analysis may publish derived scores but
-- not the annotations behind them.
--
-- Structural layer only; deterministic rows live in seed.sql and the access
-- boundary in security.sql. The database itself is created by provision.py
-- (`CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ...; USE ...;`) so that everything below is
-- ordinary DuckDB SQL: it runs unchanged against MotherDuck and against a
-- local DuckDB, which is how tests/test_cloud_fixture_sql.py exercises it.
--
--   python provision.py motherduck
--
-- taxi_zone_id is the same stable join key the PostGIS and BigQuery fixtures
-- use (zones 101..160); geometry is EPSG:4326 throughout.
