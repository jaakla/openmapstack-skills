-- Historical trip demand per taxi zone, from the BigQuery warehouse.
--
-- This is the A2 input the operational PostGIS database cannot answer: how
-- much demand a zone has actually seen over time, not how many accounts sit
-- in it today.
--
-- Rows are confined to tenant 'alpha' by the row access policy on
-- zone_daily_demand -- the query says nothing about tenants, and must not:
-- the boundary is the backend's, and a filter here would hide whether it
-- works. The dataset is named without a project so the query resolves
-- against whichever project the connector's client is pointed at.

-- STDDEV_SAMP is null for a zone with a single active day; a zone with one
-- day of data has no measured variability, and 0 is the honest reading.
