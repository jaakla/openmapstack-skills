-- Private market and POI context per taxi zone, from MotherDuck.
--
-- The A4 input: what is already around a zone -- charging, parking, transit,
-- and the competition -- combined with Northstar's own market scoring.
--
-- Reads the analysis views, never the base tables, and deliberately never
-- market.analyst_annotations: the private notes inform the scores and are
-- not republished. That is a convention this analysis honours rather than a
-- grant the backend enforces, and fixture.yaml records it as such.

-- A zone with no POIs at all is absent from the counts view, so the join is
-- a LEFT JOIN and the counts coalesce to 0: "no amenities" is a real answer,
-- not missing data.
